# Burger App
This is a node application that takes user input (a type of burger) and uses handlebars.js to display the input in the "Burgers to Eat" section of the page. The user can then click the "Devour it!" button to indicate that the burger was eaten. The burger name is then moved to the "Devoured Burgers" side of the page.

Bootstrap was used for styling.

## Node Packages Used
express, body-parser, express-handlebars, dotenv and mysql
